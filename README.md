## COURSE GOALS
This course presents how to design a relational database from requirements gathering, to conceptual and logical modeling. We also cover how to query databases using SQL, the ACID properties of a relational database management system, and fundamentals of database programming using triggers, stored procedures, functions, and events. Advanced topics include indexing, transactions, concurrency and recovery. The course will also provide an introduction to non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
### Lectures
Will focus on developing a conceptual understanding of database design & usage, as well as DBMS implementation.
### Assignments
Will ask students to apply their conceptual knowledge via problems and code implementation. There will be ~10 assignments one per week with a quiz typically scheduled shortly after assignments are due
### Team Project
Students are encouraged to form teams of one to four members to collaborate on a team project due at the end of the semester. The team project will allow students to collaboratively complete an application from start to finish, including design & creation/optimization within a DBMS, as well as a programmatic user-interface. The goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience with developing a full database application from the ground up
